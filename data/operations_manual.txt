## Supplemental Operational Procedure: Remote Deposit Capture (RDC) for Commercial Clients

1. Initial Review: Before approving a client for RDC, the Treasury Management officer must review the client's credit history and previous 6 months of deposit activity.
2. Site Inspection: For high-volume clients (> $500k/month), a physical or virtual site inspection of their scanning location is required.
3. Risk Rating: Clients are assigned a risk rating (Low, Medium, High) which determines their daily and monthly deposit limits.

### SOP 202.D: Transaction Monitoring and Exceptions

2. Exception Handling: Checks flagged for poor image quality or mismatched MICR data must be reviewed by the RDC Operations team within 2 hours.

## Comprehensive Case Studies for Agent Training

The following case studies illustrate complex compliance scenarios and are used for agent training and evaluation.

### Case Study 1: Potential Structuring and Elder Financial Abuse

Customer A, an 82-year-old long-time client, begins making cash withdrawals of $9,500 every Monday and Thursday for three consecutive weeks. When questioned by the teller, the customer appears nervous and states they are "paying for home repairs" but cannot provide a contractor's name.

**Analysis:**
- Structuring: The withdrawals are consistently just below the $10,000 CTR reporting threshold.
- Elder Abuse: Significant change in pattern for an elderly customer combined with vague explanations is a high indicator of financial exploitation.
- Action Required: File an urgent SAR and escalate to the Elder Financial Abuse task force.

### Case Study 2: Business Account with High-Risk International Activity

A local import/export business, ABC Trading LLC, receives three incoming wires from a sanctioned jurisdiction within 48 hours. The funds are immediately transferred to a personal account of a beneficial owner.

**Analysis:**
- Sanctions Violation: Receiving funds from a barred jurisdiction is a direct violation of OFAC regulations.
- Commingling of Funds: Moving business funds to a personal account without a clear purpose suggests potential money laundering or tax evasion.
- Action Required: Block the personal account immediately, freeze the incoming funds, and notify the BSA Officer for a 10-day blocking report filing.
